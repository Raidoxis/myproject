									<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/">XDA Developers</a> (also known simply as XDA; often stylized as xda-developers) is a mobile software development community of over 6.6 million members[2] worldwide, started on 20 December 2002.[3][4] Although discussion primarily revolves around Android, members also talk about many other operating systems and mobile development topics.</p>
									<p>Are you curious to know how all this started? Well, prepare yourself for a journey into the history of how XDA-Developers was born and how we arrived at where we are now. In this series of articles, we will be talking with some of the oldest members, moderators and administrators who will let us know how it all began.

The original team
Back in 2003 in the back yard of a small house situated in Amsterdam a group of enthusiasts started in depth testing on pocket pc´s, smartphones and other PDA devices.
Peter Poelman and itsme (undoubtedly there were more people involved, but these are the 2 I know for sure started xda-dev) were the first real initiators of XDA development. At that time, none of them would have imagined they would go on to create a small and humble site that would grow into the phenomenon it is today. After initial experimentation, they decided to launch a site especially designed for other developers around the world who could join them in testing/tweaking/modifying and generally improving the usability of their chosen devices. They decided to name the site XDA-DEVELOPERS, following their work with the devices made by the High Tech Computer Corporation (hTC ), who were pioneers in manufacturing PDA-phones. A leading seller of these phones was O2 who branded these phones as XDAs, PDAs with “Xtra” functions.

As the site became bigger and membership grew, other problems appeared including how to maintain control and order amongst almost 100,000 Members by 2006. The initial moderator team was composed of: vijay555, HDuser, buzz_lightyear, mikechannon and many others under the guidance of Itsme, they maintained and administered the site. A dedicated Administrator, Flar was appointed in 2006 as the site now demanded a level of administration that could not be delivered by the owners on a part-time basis in addition to their full-time jobs.</p>
									<p>Xda-developers has been here since the start, as we saw in orb3000’s part one of this two part story. I’m here to cover the more recent news and what has come out of our community. From rooting and ROM development, to flashing and hacking, XDA members and developers have been the ones sustaining this community and are the reason we have had so much fun playing with our devices.
After XDA hit the ground running, it didn’t take long for us to make our first breakthroughs and become the first in the smartphone scene to have a site as unique as xda-developers.

As the population started growing on the site, we soon saw more development of ROMs and apps for Windows CE and Windows Mobile devices. This type of development was never done before as apps were locked by the manufacturer and carriers. Along the way, we have seen some great projects and things come out of XDA that is truly what the spirit behind the site is. Not far behind, was the addition of XDA’s first non-htc device along with other additions such as Android. These changes were all made in 2009. As quoted from a quick interview with xda-developer and Senior Moderator Chainfire:

“The key to XDA’s continued success has been the addition of new devices and OS’s, which have broadened the community and united it all under one roof where people can collaborate and develop many great things for their smartphones.”
Some of the new things that have been part of these additions were:

Android on Windows Mobile Phones – Development
Android Rom Development and Customization
Android Rooting
And with all this activity, it sure hasn’t been hard to write stories on such development.

If you haven’t been around long on XDA then you may have not noticed the big increase in users. XDA now grows at a rate of roughly 3,000-5,000 new users a day. The site also has a constant 10,000 users online on average at any given time. With so many new devices and users, there is a lot of content that comes out of XDA. Everyday it seems there is a new ROM, application, or tweak that a user has made.

Part of keeping the site the way it is, is because of the dedicated staff that works the forums and the behind the scenes operations. We have Administrators, Senior Moderators, Forum Specific Moderators, and of course the News Writers. We all work tirelessly to make sure the users are behaving, some of you may not like us for our actions but we have lots of responsibilities. Since there are 2.8 Million users and only about 100 moderators, that is a ratio of 1 moderator for every 28,000 users. As of this last Summer XDA has implemented a new moderation system designating some moderators to forums and others to a more general area. Keep in mind that all moderators are non-paid volunteers who dedicate countless hours to make sure the site runs smooth and isn’t in a total chaos.

So far, we have only been inclusive to Android and Win Mo OS’s. Recently, XDA admins Svetius and Arbre announced the addition of iphone-developers.com to the XDA family. The site is up and running in beta and hopefully we will see some great development come from the Apple side of development and more openness with this OS. We may also see an addition of other OS’s down the road depending on their popularity and development possibilities. When Android was introduced, we became a major benefactor to the OS and we hope to see this happen again with another mobile platforms.</p>
